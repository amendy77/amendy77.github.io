## Salvare Search for Rescue Web Application<br/>CS340 Client/Server Development<br/>Databases Category

---

An existing database from animal shelters is used by the web application Salvare Search for Rescue.  This aids in identifying and classifying dogs that are available for training in various rescue scenarios, including water, mountain, or wilderness rescue, locating people following a tragedy, or tracing the smell of a specific human.  The program facilitates training from a MongoDB database by allowing users to interact with and view individual dog profiles.

This artifact entails the engineering of procedures for input data validation as well as the architect and design of default denials for database record access.  By anticipating adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs, this talent helps me develop a security mentality that protects privacy, mitigates design faults, and ensures improved data security and resource utilization.  The source code supports clean code with descriptive function and variable names, is well-documented, and has an easy-to-maintain commenting style that complies with Python standards.  The database records are handled by the CRUD module, which allows code reuse by allowing other Python programs to import it as a module.

The implemented data structure is programmatic, where the stored variable values can be used efficiently in different functions and callbacks through the web application. This approach improves the design and evaluation of computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to it while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. As shown in the short video, I accomplished the process of recreating the web app in a Windows environment. I produced a working program beyond the initial Linux environment, which required researching things I have done in other languages to create an artifact on multiple operating systems like Windows and macOS.

As a document database, MongoDB brings a facility to manage significant data and makes it easy to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. This format directly maps to native objects in modern programming languages, making it a natural choice as I don't need to think about normalizing data. The web application's CRUD is transparent and straightforward. However, the dashboard development using the Dash framework was more time-consuming. Understanding and exploring how the dash core, HTML components, and callbacks work to produce an efficient and straightforward coding structure.

There is a lot behind the DASH framework, and their libraries are under active development, so installation and upgrade frequently are necessary. With the reproduction of the web application in a different environment, I update and actualize the web app documentation to guide others in recreating the web app in a Linux or Windows environment. The clear and well-documented guide improves my skill in designing, developing, and delivering professional written and visual communication documentation that is coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
