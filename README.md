### *Professional Self-Assessment:*

My experience in my computer science program was quite difficult, but it was well worth it. The reason for this was that I had no prior software engineering experience. Having worked in the medical sector for more than 15 years,
I felt the need to make a difference in my life one night while working an overnight shift. A change that demanded more of me, a challenge that forced me to think creatively and come up with answers. Due to this change, 
I had to apply to Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor of Computer Science program with a Software Information Security. One may wonder why there has been such a large shift, but I respond that I love technology
and that I am motivated to change the world by not only working directly with patients but also by applying my previous medical training and expertise to create revolutionary medical software.

I was prepared after finishing my education, knowing that I would have to put in a lot of effort and have many sleepless nights.The aggravation of not knowing how to code any language, not being able to solve 
a particular problem or application, and not knowing of anyone with a degree in computer science to seek assistance from made me feel like I was about to cry myself to tears at times. 
However, I've never given up because I enjoy a challenge, therefore I emerged victorious as always!

To demonstrate my strengths, I had to use my preferred language, Java, and I'll admit that I still have some work to do, but I'm prepared to put in the effort.  The next was MySQL, with which I was hardly familiar.
Python was the first language I learnt when I started at SNHU, and it looked very simple. Then came C++, which I found really confusing because I was still getting used to Python. After that, Java was introduced, and although it was similar to C++,
the principles were simpler to understand (at least for me). After that, I realized that I was at ease with Java programming, and since many businesses, including healthcare systems, utilize Java, I wanted to use it to improve my abilities
even more by using it in my Zoo application.  Even though I knew MySQL was a database manipulation language, we weren't always required to use it in my program. To demonstrate my progress beyond my introductory SQL course, 
I wanted to use MySQL to improve a messaging app from scratch using Sublime Text when it was initially built with Codio.

I wasn't always working alone during my computer science course. In a group setting, I worked with others.  Our team's task of developing a Jukebox Playlist Application made programming seem unreal because
I was working on a project with a lot of people, which inspired me to desire more group interactions‚Äîthis time in the real world. During my time in my CS-310 Collaboration and Team project course, this collaboration was born. 
Bitbucket, which facilitated remote contributor collaboration on a project, was used in this course to practice proper versioning and change control procedures. I had a great time and became excited to begin working in the field.

I studied the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as a developer and tester in order to evaluate documentation and effectively communicate with stakeholders throughout my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course.  
I learned best practices for creating high-quality software and the importance of documentation and communication by implementing the SDLC in an agile development environment.  All things considered, I found this course enjoyable since I am a highly analytical and thorough person, so completing a Software Requirement Specification (SRS Document) helped to ensure that everyone was in agreement and that everyone needed to communicate well in order for our software to be designed properly.

It's critical to understand the proper application architecture and algorithm usage to ensure that your software operates without causing undue strain on your system.  Fortunately, I had the opportunity to observe firsthand in the CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course.  I had to write code and learn non-coding development techniques for algorithmic design and problem-solving during the semester.  Considering the necessity of employing sophisticated algorithmic designs to assess intricate data structures in order to facilitate problem-solving.  So I decided to make use of my Zoo. The application below demonstrates my deeper comprehension of the authentication system's data and how my algorithms will explain the data transformation process.  making the structure faster than when I started it a few years ago, simpler, and easier to maintain.

I originally learned about software engineering and databases in my DAD-220 Introduction to SQL course.  Through the use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries, I had learned how to construct structured databases, manipulate them, and analyze data.  We used Codio for this course, and although I had never heard of it before, I quickly came to appreciate how user-friendly the IDE was. As a result, I enjoyed how straightforward but sometimes complicated MySQL can be if you write the wrong code. Since I had never worked with MySQL before, I wanted to demonstrate my abilities and development by re-creating a database management system (DBMS) to improve a messaging app from this particular course. This would show how I was able to arrange the data collection to communicate with users, add new features, and even add a security element that wasn't included in the original application.

One of the main elements of software is security.  Professionals that care about security believe that only the right people should be able to access data in a computer system.  Thus, one of the most crucial strategies for shielding a program from unfavorable and unexpected events is defense programming.  After learning about defense-in-depth and no trust in my CS-405 Secure Coding course, I realized that my Zoo application was incredibly vulnerable.  My login information, followed by passwords that were transformed into MD5 hashes, were hardcoded and embedded in the program. This lesson made it clear to me why storing such information in my source code gives a threat actor the ability to enter their own hardcoded credentials, opening a backdoor that permits assaults to take control of software, devices, firmware, and systems.  Because of this, I had to verify and validate every input in my application to keep hackers in mind.  This also applies to my database messaging program because it lacked security features, making it vulnerable to SQL injections.  For instance, an attacker could have found my hardcoded login information, mimicked a user to obtain database privileges, and created their input or content to transmit malicious SQL instructions that were run inside the database.Thankfully, with everything I now know, I will save time and money by securing my artifacts below and all of my future programs with protection programming from the start.

To wrap up my self-evaluation, I've provided two artifacts that complement my portfolios overall‚Äîone of which I used twice in two distinct categories.  As previously said, those artifacts were a Zoo application that I initially constructed for my IT-145 course, which I utilized to demonstrate my proficiency in both software design and engineering as well as my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. The othere was CS340 which Showcases how computer science may help firms reach their objectives by increasing operational efficiency and decision-making.  employing technologies like Python and MongoDB to learn how to design and develop software systems, with an emphasis on useful skills like applying design patterns, effective software design principles, and client-server ideas.

### *Software Design and Engineering: Zoo Authentication Enhancement*

I decided to use my Zoo Application for User Authentication as my artifact for my Software Design and Engineering category.  With the help of this application, an authentication system was created to allow certain users to access just the information relevant to their function within a computer system.  First, I worked on this final project for my IT-145-J4460: Foundation in Application Development course.
Since this was one of the first courses I took that exposed me to Java, I chose this artifact.  I loved this course so much that I knew I wanted to work as a Java developer.  Even though I developed a strong interest in the language, I knew I still had a long way to go before I could become skilled enough to land respectable jobs.  I therefore realized that the best course of action for me was to apply from the start of my degree and build on the knowledge I had gained over time.As a result, the particular elements of the artifact that best demonstrate my aptitude for software development allowed me to take advantage of simplicity by successfully separating my functions rather than combining them into a single class for reusability.  I designed straightforward constructors using recommended standards, and I commented on them to illustrate my code and method behaviors.  Finally, since my initial program had all of the passwords hardcoded into it, allowing for all types of weaknesses, I coded more advanced security mechanisms to be incorporated.  As an illustration:

      // Validate if user or credentials is valid
      public static boolean isValidUser(Map<String, String> credentials, String user, String pass) {

         // Validate if scenario is valid
         if (credentials == null || user == null || pass == null) {
      // Always return false for negative scenarios
      return false;
         }

         boolean isValid = false;
         Credentials cred = new Credentials(pass);
         try {
      if (credentials.containsKey(user) && credentials.containsValue(cred.generateEncryptedPassword())) {
         isValid = true;
      }
         } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
         }
         return isValid;
      }
As I thought back on the process of improving and changing my artifact, I realized how important it is to fully concentrate on creating clear, effective code and how to apply the knowledge I gained from my Secure Coding course to safeguard my application.  I discovered how to create a sophisticated application that is portable and easy to understand.  How adding an admin text file, a credential text file, a veterinarian text file, a zookeeper text file, a role class, an MD5 digest class, an MD5 Hash class, a class that reads in my file, a main class, and a README file that details the program's precise purpose enhanced my artifact. In order to follow best practices and enable any user seeing my codes to fully comprehend my program, I had to include comments where needed in my codes.  Last but not least, I had to create algorithms that would validate user login attempts, validate hash passwords, and test and validate all inputs‚Äîwhether they were taken from any of my previously mentioned text files‚Äîin order to construct my program with hackers in mind.  I would thus have a Zoo application that complies with all coding standards and best practices and demonstrates how, during my time as a Computer Science, Software Engineering student at Southern New Hampshire University, my programming abilities have developed via repetition.

### *Algorithms and Data Structure: the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App *
For the databases category, the Salvare Search for Rescue Web App was chosen as the artifact. In order to locate and classify suitable canines for training for various rescues, the web application seeks to create an online interface that integrates with an existing database from animal shelters. For the computer science course CS340 Client/Server Development, the web application was planned, created, and designed. The Dash framework and the non-relational database MongoDB are used in the Python development of the application. PyMongo is a Python driver that integrates Python with MongoDB. The program can be used as a test tool in a Jupyter Notebook and as a computer terminal that has an internet browser. A CSV file of all the dogs that are currently in shelters is imported into MongoDB as part of the application's functionality. Dependencies including the Python PyMongo driver, Python libraries, and Dash framework are also loaded, and a Python source code and CRUD module are used to work with the data that has been imported into MongoDB.
This artifact was chosen because it had a multi-tier application that used an application programming interface (API) and a Model View Controller (MVC) in conjunction with a RESTful protocol design to extend the HTTP protocol. The MVC pattern's separation of concerns is its most alluring idea. The role of the model is to handle Python data structures, MongoDB, and data. The view is responsible for determining what the user sees and how on the Dash framework. The controller is in charge of pulling, modifying, and supplying the user with PyMongo driver data.
Every record in the MongoDB database is a document that is described in BSON, which is a binary version of the JSON-formatted data that the web application retrieves. When the user launches the main application file in the computer terminal, a new tab in their browser opens that points to the app address (for example, http://127.0.0.1:8050/). When the browser loads, the client-facing web application dashboard appears, as shown in the screen below:

As demonstrated in the brief video, I successfully recreated the online application within a Windows environment. Beyond the initial Linux environment, I was able to create a functional application, which necessitated investigating my work in other languages in order to create an artifact that could run on several operating systems, such as Windows and macOS.

### *Databases: CS-340 Client/Server Development*

For the databases category, the artifact is a CS-340 project that was finished on June 6, 2024.  This Python file serves as the back end structure of an interactive database for animal rescue organizations and was created to work with PyMongo.  While the post-enhancement artifact has more sophisticated SQL capabilities, the pre-enhancement item has more fundamental CRUD functionality.

This project was chosen as my third artifact because it provides a great illustration of the back-end database construction process.  Languages like Python are frequently used to search and alter the data found in large databases.  During the enhancement phase, I made considerable enhancements to my artifact, including adding SQL capabilities to create, read, update, and delete, as well as other improvements like count, insert multiple, update multiple, and delete multiple commands.  These improvements demonstrate how to update and extend SQL and Python data structure code.

I believe I met all of the course requirements I needed to in order to reach this milestone.¬† My artifact's capability was upgraded to include count, delete multiple, insert multiple, and update multiple SQL commands, and its complexity was increased.  As of right now, my outcome coverage policies are not updated.

While improving my project, I gained an appreciation for both simple and complex SQL statements, particularly those related to creation, read, update, and delete (CRUD).  I was able to establish a working database for animal rescues in my initial project by simply including those four SQL procedures into my Python code.  After I updated my code, I discovered how much a few tweaks may improve the project's final design.
