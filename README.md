Professional Self-Assessment:

My experience in my computer science program was quite difficult, but it was well worth it. The reason for this was that I had no prior software engineering experience. Having worked in the medical sector for more than 15 years,
I felt the need to make a difference in my life one night while working an overnight shift. A change that demanded more of me, a challenge that forced me to think creatively and come up with answers. Due to this change, 
I had to apply to Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor of Computer Science program with a Software Information Security. One may wonder why there has been such a large shift, but I respond that I love technology
and that I am motivated to change the world by not only working directly with patients but also by applying my previous medical training and expertise to create revolutionary medical software.

I was prepared after finishing my education, knowing that I would have to put in a lot of effort and have many sleepless nights.The aggravation of not knowing how to code any language, not being able to solve 
a particular problem or application, and not knowing of anyone with a degree in computer science to seek assistance from made me feel like I was about to cry myself to tears at times. 
However, I've never given up because I enjoy a challenge, therefore I emerged victorious as always!

To demonstrate my strengths, I had to use my preferred language, Java, and I'll admit that I still have some work to do, but I'm prepared to put in the effort.  The next was MySQL, with which I was hardly familiar.
Python was the first language I learnt when I started at SNHU, and it looked very simple. Then came C++, which I found really confusing because I was still getting used to Python. After that, Java was introduced, and although it was similar to C++,
the principles were simpler to understand (at least for me). After that, I realized that I was at ease with Java programming, and since many businesses, including healthcare systems, utilize Java, I wanted to use it to improve my abilities
even more by using it in my Zoo application.  Even though I knew MySQL was a database manipulation language, we weren't always required to use it in my program. To demonstrate my progress beyond my introductory SQL course, 
I wanted to use MySQL to improve a messaging app from scratch using Sublime Text when it was initially built with Codio.

I wasn't always working alone during my computer science course. In a group setting, I worked with others.  Our team's task of developing a Jukebox Playlist Application made programming seem unreal because
I was working on a project with a lot of people, which inspired me to desire more group interactions‚Äîthis time in the real world. During my time in my CS-310 Collaboration and Team project course, this collaboration was born. 
Bitbucket, which facilitated remote contributor collaboration on a project, was used in this course to practice proper versioning and change control procedures. I had a great time and became excited to begin working in the field.

I studied the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as a developer and tester in order to evaluate documentation and effectively communicate with stakeholders throughout my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course.  
I learned best practices for creating high-quality software and the importance of documentation and communication by implementing the SDLC in an agile development environment.  All things considered, I found this course enjoyable since I am a highly analytical and thorough person, so completing a Software Requirement Specification (SRS Document) helped to ensure that everyone was in agreement and that everyone needed to communicate well in order for our software to be designed properly.

It's critical to understand the proper application architecture and algorithm usage to ensure that your software operates without causing undue strain on your system.  Fortunately, I had the opportunity to observe firsthand in the CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course.  I had to write code and learn non-coding development techniques for algorithmic design and problem-solving during the semester.  Considering the necessity of employing sophisticated algorithmic designs to assess intricate data structures in order to facilitate problem-solving.  So I decided to make use of my Zoo. The application below demonstrates my deeper comprehension of the authentication system's data and how my algorithms will explain the data transformation process.  making the structure faster than when I started it a few years ago, simpler, and easier to maintain.

I originally learned about software engineering and databases in my DAD-220 Introduction to SQL course.  Through the use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries, I had learned how to construct structured databases, manipulate them, and analyze data.  We used Codio for this course, and although I had never heard of it before, I quickly came to appreciate how user-friendly the IDE was. As a result, I enjoyed how straightforward but sometimes complicated MySQL can be if you write the wrong code. Since I had never worked with MySQL before, I wanted to demonstrate my abilities and development by re-creating a database management system (DBMS) to improve a messaging app from this particular course. This would show how I was able to arrange the data collection to communicate with users, add new features, and even add a security element that wasn't included in the original application.

One of the main elements of software is security.  Professionals that care about security believe that only the right people should be able to access data in a computer system.  Thus, one of the most crucial strategies for shielding a program from unfavorable and unexpected events is defense programming.  After learning about defense-in-depth and no trust in my CS-405 Secure Coding course, I realized that my Zoo application was incredibly vulnerable.  My login information, followed by passwords that were transformed into MD5 hashes, were hardcoded and embedded in the program. This lesson made it clear to me why storing such information in my source code gives a threat actor the ability to enter their own hardcoded credentials, opening a backdoor that permits assaults to take control of software, devices, firmware, and systems.  Because of this, I had to verify and validate every input in my application to keep hackers in mind.  This also applies to my database messaging program because it lacked security features, making it vulnerable to SQL injections.  For instance, an attacker could have found my hardcoded login information, mimicked a user to obtain database privileges, and created their input or content to transmit malicious SQL instructions that were run inside the database.Thankfully, with everything I now know, I will save time and money by securing my artifacts below and all of my future programs with protection programming from the start.

To wrap up my self-evaluation, I've provided two artifacts that complement my portfolios overall‚Äîone of which I used twice in two distinct categories.  As previously said, those artifacts were a Zoo application that I initially constructed for my IT-145 course, which I utilized to demonstrate my proficiency in both software design and engineering as well as my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. The othere was CS340 which Showcases how computer science may help firms reach their objectives by increasing operational efficiency and decision-making.  employing technologies like Python and MongoDB to learn how to design and develop software systems, with an emphasis on useful skills like applying design patterns, effective software design principles, and client-server ideas.

Code Review

Below is a link directly to my YouTube page where I uploaded my Code Review where I addressed the following:

[x] Existing functionality: Walk through and identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works.

[x] Code Analysis: Review the code structure, look for code efficiencies, and check for comments and code documentation. Explain your findings.

[x] Look for enhancement: Walk through and explain planned enhancements.
